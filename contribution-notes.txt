 Notes
--------
 *  This program achieves causal consistency by establishing a total order 

 *  using a consensus algorithm, specifically Paxos. Nodes that join the 

 *  cluster replay the totally ordered history before responding to requests.

 *  It's not done. I'm sorry for the mess, and thank you for looking it over.

 *  I'm really sorry. I can't say it enough. I don't envy you the task ahead 
    of you. I'll be working on it further in the coming days, but for now, 
    really, it's a mess. I'm sorry you aren't grading the finished program.

 *  I couldn't get the TA scripts to work. If you like, start ./proc2.sh 
    through proc9.sh, then run test.sh to run my own unit tests. (But you 
    don't have to. I really ought to have tried harder to get the TA scripts 
    running.)

 *  I _think_ the consensus algorithm is implemented correctly. However, 
    replaying logs to catch up new nodes doesn't work.

 *  Payloads are icky-looking due to how my program interacts with Gson. Sorry.

 *  Note about Paxos: The Paxos algorithm only needs to wait for a majority of 
    responses, but realistically because this program is implemented using 
    Java (with exception handling for errors) on top of TCP (a reliable 
    protocol), we're going to hear back from all of the nodes--although we 
    can't (and don't) assume the responses will indicate success.
